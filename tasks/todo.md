# Account deletion safety

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Free promotional credits can be forfeited only after an explicit confirmation.
- [x] Active transcription jobs and unresolved payment/refund states block deletion.
- [x] A remaining balance with an unresolved paid order routes the user to refund review.
- [x] Payment orders survive account deletion without retaining the account email.
- [x] Transcription data, usage history, temporary audio, sessions, and the Auth user are removed.
- [x] Google-only users reauthenticate with Google rather than entering a password.
- [x] A deletion tombstone prevents a still-valid JWT from recreating the profile.
- [x] Tests and the production client build pass before deployment.

## Checklist

- [x] Inspect current Auth, payment, job, Storage, and foreign-key behavior.
- [x] Validate Supabase's current user deletion and session behavior.
- [x] Add the backward-compatible database migration.
- [x] Add account deletion preview and execution APIs.
- [x] Add the account settings confirmation flow.
- [x] Align terms and privacy copy with the deletion policy.
- [x] Add regression coverage.
- [x] Run tests and build.
- [x] Review the final diff and deployment order.

## Working notes

- `profiles.credits` does not distinguish free and paid balances.
- Conservative rule: any positive balance plus an unrefunded paid order requires review.
- All pending orders block automatic deletion; stale orders require payment reconciliation before the account can be removed.
- `payment_orders.user_id` currently cascades from `profiles`; it must become nullable with `ON DELETE SET NULL`.
- Auth access tokens may remain valid until expiry, so a hashed deletion tombstone must block profile recreation.
- Supabase CLI is not installed in this workspace; the migration file is being added directly and will be validated before application.

## Results

- `npm test`: 98 passed, 0 failed.
- `npm run build`: passed with 56 modules transformed.
- Desktop and 390px mobile account-deletion screens render without horizontal overflow.
- Google reauthentication returns to `/settings`, uses the real `last_sign_in_at`, and requests account selection.
- Production migration applied before the app deployment; existing payment rows were unchanged.
- Database verification: payment FK uses `ON DELETE SET NULL`, deletion RLS is enabled, browser RPC access is denied, and `service_role` access is enabled.
- Supabase advisors reported only intentional no-policy RLS notices plus pre-existing leaked-password protection and unused-index notices.

# Basic plan price adjustment

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] New Basic orders are created for 5,900 KRW and 100 minutes.
- [x] The payment page shows 5,900 KRW, 40% off, and 59 KRW per minute.
- [x] Margin calculations use 59 KRW per minute for the Basic plan.
- [x] Existing orders keep their stored amount for confirmation and refunds.
- [x] Local tests and the production build pass.
- [ ] CI and production deployment pass.

## Checklist

- [x] Locate the server catalog, client display, benchmark, and payment tests.
- [x] Update the new-order price without rewriting historical order amounts.
- [x] Add regression coverage for server/client/benchmark price alignment.
- [x] Run the full test suite and production build.
- [ ] Review the final diff and deploy.

## Working notes

- The server plan catalog is authoritative for new Toss orders.
- Confirmation and refund paths use the amount stored on each order, so pre-change 4,900 KRW orders remain valid.
- The 9,900 KRW reference price remains unchanged; the displayed discount changes from 50% to 40%.

## Results

- `npm test`: 135 passed, 0 failed.
- `npm run build`: passed with 58 modules transformed.
- `git diff --check`: passed.
- CI and production deployment are pending.

# Public personal phone removal

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] The site footer no longer displays the owner's personal mobile number.
- [x] The privacy policy no longer displays the owner's personal mobile number.
- [x] The customer support email remains available in both locations.
- [x] Regression coverage prevents a Korean mobile number from being reintroduced in these public views.
- [x] Local tests and the production build pass.
- [ ] CI and production deployment pass.

## Checklist

- [x] Search the public client for mobile-number and contact references.
- [x] Remove only the personal phone fields without leaving duplicate separators.
- [x] Add regression coverage.
- [x] Run the full test suite, production build, and diff checks.
- [ ] Deploy and verify the production footer, privacy page, and health endpoint.

## Working notes

- The personal mobile number appeared only in `Layout.jsx` and `PrivacyPage.jsx`.
- Email remains the public privacy and customer-support contact channel.
- Before commercial launch, replace the removed number with a dedicated business/customer-service number to satisfy applicable online-sales disclosure requirements.

## Results

- `npm test`: 136 passed, 0 failed.
- `npm run build`: passed with 58 modules transformed.
- `git diff --check`: passed.
- Current client source and production build contain no Korean mobile-number pattern.
- CI and production deployment are pending.

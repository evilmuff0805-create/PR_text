# Account deletion safety

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Free promotional credits can be forfeited only after an explicit confirmation.
- [x] Active transcription jobs and unresolved payment/refund states block deletion.
- [x] A remaining balance with an unresolved paid order routes the user to refund review.
- [x] Payment orders survive account deletion without retaining the account email.
- [x] Transcription data, usage history, temporary audio, sessions, and the Auth user are removed.
- [x] Google-only users reauthenticate with Google rather than entering a password.
- [x] A deletion tombstone prevents a still-valid JWT from recreating the profile.
- [x] Tests and the production client build pass before deployment.

## Checklist

- [x] Inspect current Auth, payment, job, Storage, and foreign-key behavior.
- [x] Validate Supabase's current user deletion and session behavior.
- [x] Add the backward-compatible database migration.
- [x] Add account deletion preview and execution APIs.
- [x] Add the account settings confirmation flow.
- [x] Align terms and privacy copy with the deletion policy.
- [x] Add regression coverage.
- [x] Run tests and build.
- [x] Review the final diff and deployment order.

## Working notes

- `profiles.credits` does not distinguish free and paid balances.
- Conservative rule: any positive balance plus an unrefunded paid order requires review.
- All pending orders block automatic deletion; stale orders require payment reconciliation before the account can be removed.
- `payment_orders.user_id` currently cascades from `profiles`; it must become nullable with `ON DELETE SET NULL`.
- Auth access tokens may remain valid until expiry, so a hashed deletion tombstone must block profile recreation.
- Supabase CLI is not installed in this workspace; the migration file is being added directly and will be validated before application.

## Results

- `npm test`: 98 passed, 0 failed.
- `npm run build`: passed with 56 modules transformed.
- Desktop and 390px mobile account-deletion screens render without horizontal overflow.
- Google reauthentication returns to `/settings`, uses the real `last_sign_in_at`, and requests account selection.
- Production migration applied before the app deployment; existing payment rows were unchanged.
- Database verification: payment FK uses `ON DELETE SET NULL`, deletion RLS is enabled, browser RPC access is denied, and `service_role` access is enabled.
- Supabase advisors reported only intentional no-policy RLS notices plus pre-existing leaked-password protection and unused-index notices.
